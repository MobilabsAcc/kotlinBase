/**
 * Challenge 1 - The bakery
 *
 * The Warsaw bakery called "Cukiernia - ACC" is famous of it's donuts. It has 2 different kinds of
 * those (standard - 2zł, extra large - 3.5zł) and each can be served with a different topping
 * (cranberry/blueberry/raspberry/strawberry jam, nutella - 1zł). The overall price of the donut equals
 * to the price of donut itself + the price of topping (can be more than one). Due limited number of
 * exclusive donuts the bakery can sell one donut at a time.
 *
 * Goal: implement the bakery, donut, topping, order abstractions reflecting the above case.
